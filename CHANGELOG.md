v.0.5.64

***THE MOD WILL BE MOVING TO 1.20.4 SHORTLY***

- Fixes egg rendering.
- Tweaks block breaking so the Classic Xenos doesn't bleed on blocks above it when in a 3 tall area.
- Fixes egg towers
- Re-enables random walk task on Classic Xenos
- Fixes Huggers targetting undead.

Please note that Neos are still heavily WIP and not considered released until posted. This is why you can't find eggs in the creative menu without the config option.
No bug reports will be accepted for them until they have reached what we feel is release status ready.
