v.0.5.65

***THE MOD WILL BE MOVING TO 1.20.5 AND 1.20.1 WILL BE SUNSET OUTSIDE ANY MAJOR CRASHES***

## FIXES
- Fixes Eggs not hatching in anything not solid like fluids or other non-solid blocks like resin.

## NEW
- Adds tags for each group of xenos, allowing better datapack support for calling any gig aliens by type.
- Adds Gig Stairs to vanilla stair tag.
- enableDevparticles now enables pathfinding debug when enabled and hitboxes are shown for Gig crawlers.

## CHANGES
- Completely reworked crawling library to better crawl and pathfind. Getting stuck on corners is a known issue and is being looked into.
- Heavy tweaks rotations when crawling and tunnel crawling (some issues still exist for tunnel animations)
- Refactored AdultAlienEntity into base AlienEntity.
- Moved Classic Xenos task checks to AI tasks.

- Resin is now placed by Xenos in random sizes.
- Refactors Task AI.

Please note that Neos are still heavily WIP and not considered released until posted. This is why you can't find eggs in the creative menu without the config option.
No bug reports will be accepted for them until they have reached what we feel is release status ready.
