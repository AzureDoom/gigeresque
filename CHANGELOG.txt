v.0.5.56

- Updates required AzureLib version to v1.0.32.
- Adds AzureLib to Connector builds required mods list, no longer bundled as you can use the Forge version safely with Fabric mods.

Please note that Neos are still heavily WIP and not considered released until posted. This is why you can't find eggs in the creative menu.
No bug reports will be accepted for them until they have reached what we feel is release status ready.
