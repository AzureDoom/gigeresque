v.0.5.59

- Fixes young texture issue on Classic Xenos when crawling. Closes #205
- Fix added for entity placement if entity is already in that spot. Closes #195
- Massive clean up code/publishing.

Please note that Neos are still heavily WIP and not considered released until posted. This is why you can't find eggs in the creative menu.
No bug reports will be accepted for them until they have reached what we feel is release status ready.
