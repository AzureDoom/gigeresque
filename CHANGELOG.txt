v.0.5.47

- Fixed broken rotation on huggers.
- Removes Martian Raptor from Runner tag as they are considered undead.

Please note that Neos are still heavily WIP and not considered released until posted. This is why you can't find eggs in the creative menu.
No bug reports will be accepted for them until they have reached what we feel is release status ready.
