* The Facehugger simply stops riding the player and will jump back on when they rejoin if they are in the same spot.

Please note that Neos are still heavily WIP and not considered released until posted. This is why you can't find eggs in the creative menu.
No bug reports will be accepted for them until they have reached what we feel is release status ready.
