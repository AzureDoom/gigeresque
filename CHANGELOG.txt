v.0.5.39

- Fixes Eggs opening when spawned due to broken check.
- Fixes Dungeons missing a room.
- Fixes Aliens bleeding on grass blocks.
- Fixes Facehuggers rendering glitch with grass blocks.
- Structures now spawn higher in the world.
- Facehuggers now jump out of the eggs in a random direction instead of always straight up.

- Added new config enabling particles for the aliens listening. Used for debugging.

Please note that Neos are still heavily WIP and not considered released until posted. This is why you can't find eggs in the creative menu.
No bug reports will be accepted for them until they have reached what we feel is release status ready.
